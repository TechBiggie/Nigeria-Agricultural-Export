First, we’ll look at Sales performance:
● What are the top-selling products?
● Which company has the highest sales revenue?
● How do sales vary across different export countries? You should look at
○ Product sales
○ average revenue per country
○ Total units sold
● Is there any correlation between the units sold and the profit generated?
Let’s talk Time-Series:
● How do sales vary over time (monthly, quarterly, annually)?
● Are there any seasonal trends in sales?
● Is there a relationship between the date of purchase and the profit margin?
Following up will be our Cost Analysis:
● What is the cost of goods sold (COGS) as a percentage of revenue?
● How does the COGS vary across different products?
We can still work with our geographic data:
● Which destination ports receive the highest volume of exports?
● What are the transportation modes commonly used for export?
● Rank the destination port by the export value.
● Show the top export product for each port.
We have a performance comparison:
● How does each product perform in terms of profit margin?
● Can we compare the performance of different companies based on units sold and
profit generated?
● Are there any outliers or underperforming products/companies that need attention?
